**The Need to State the Logic**

Now clearly, it is not enough simply to group the ideas in a logical way without also stating to yourself what the logic of the relationship is. The point in grouping was not just to move from a set of nine items to separate sets of four, two, and three items. That still comes to nine. What you want to do is move above the nine, to three.

This means that instead of remembering each of the nine items, you remember only the three categories into which they fal1. You are thinking one level of abstraction higher, but because the thought is at a higher level, it suggests the items below it. And, because the relationship is not a contrived one as was the case in the exercise about the lake and the sugar, it is much easier to keep in mind.

#### ORDERING FROM THE TOP DOWN
The clearest sequence is always to give the summarizing idea before you give the individual ideas being summarized. 1 cannot emphasize this point too much. 

I have given you a piece of information, and without realizing it you will automatically make some assumptions about the reason for my giving you that inforrnation.

==The reader is always going to look for a structure connecting the ideas as they come to him. To make sure he finds the one you intended, you must tell him in advance what it is-to make sure he knows what to look for.== Otherwise he is likely either to see an unintended relationship, or worse, none at a11, in which case you have both wasted your time.

> ðŸ’¡ Present the idea using the top-down approach (pyramid structure) even the content has been prepared in the bottom-up manner.

#### THINKING FROM THE BOTTOM UP

If you think for a moment about what you actua11y do when you write, you can see that you develop your major ideas by thinking in this bottom-up manner. At the very lowest level in the pyramid, you group together sentences, each containing an individual idea, into paragraphs.

3 rules:

1. Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.
2. Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea. 
3. Ideas in each grouping must always be logically ordered.
