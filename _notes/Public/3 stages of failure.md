[[James Clear]] [[Mindset]] [[Start with Why]]

1.  **Stage 1 is a Failure of Tactics.** These are HOW mistakes. They occur when you fail to build robust systems, forget to measure carefully, and get lazy with the details. A Failure of Tactics is a failure to execute on a good plan and a clear vision.
2.  **Stage 2 is a Failure of Strategy.** These are WHAT mistakes. They occur when you follow a strategy that fails to deliver the results you want. You can know _why_ you do the things you do and you can know _how_ to do the work, but still choose the wrong _what_ to make it happen.
3.  **Stage 3 is a Failure of Vision.** These are WHY mistakes. They occur when you don't set a clear direction for yourself, follow a vision that doesn't fulfill you, or otherwise fail to understand why you do the things you do.
