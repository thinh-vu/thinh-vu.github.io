Greetings and welcome to my Digital Garden project, a space where I openly share my notes before refining them into permanent blog posts that can be found on my website,Â [Thinh Vu Blog](https://thinhvu.com/). Here, you will find a collection of my musings and insights on various topics that I am passionate about. Feel free to explore and engage with me in discussions as we cultivate and nurture this digital garden together.

I use Obsidian and Jekyll garden theme to built this site. Check the <a href="{{'/post/features' | relative_url}}"> features </a> page to know more.

Check [[Hidden Note]] to know how to create notes which won't appear on the feed!
